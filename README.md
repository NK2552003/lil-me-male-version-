# 🎨 Fun SVG Animation  

A lightweight and fun SVG animation created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—without relying on any external libraries. This project demonstrates how to breathe life into static illustrations using pure web development techniques.  

## 🌟 Features  

- **Pure CSS Animations**: Includes smooth floating, blinking, and breathing effects using custom keyframes.  
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Animations are enhanced when you hover over the avatar.  
- **Responsive Design**: Scales beautifully across devices with flexible SVG dimensions.  
- **No External Dependencies**: Built entirely with native web technologies for simplicity and performance.  

## 🎥 Demo

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **HTML**: To structure the SVG and container elements.  
- **CSS**: For animations, transformations, and styling.  
- **JavaScript**: To enhance interactivity and trigger animations dynamically.

## 🖌️ How It Works
- The SVG is structured using scalable vector graphics for clean visuals.
- CSS keyframes animate properties like transform, scale, and opacity to create effects like floating, blinking, and breathing.
- A touch of JavaScript ensures animations start dynamically when the page loads.
